## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I learned how to use css box-shadow, being able to use box-shadow is a great skill which is highly ignored and developers end up with bad designs over this.
 I also learned how to use ```root: ``` in css, it's a neat trick to avoid redundancy of certain aspects of code. For instance, having all your colors in root makes things easy as it is easy to access them through out the css file, relieving you from always needing to remember what color code you used.

```css
:root {
  --cyan-clr: #2ab2af;
  --bright-yellow-clr: #c0df34;
  --light-gray-clr: #e5eff5;
  --grayish-blue: #98a6bd;
  --light-cyan: #37b6b4;
  --light-weight: 400;
  --bold-weight: 700;
  --font-family: "Karla";
}
```


### Continued development

The area I would likely continue focusing on in future projects for now would be the box-shadow as it is a tricky subject and a little bit hard to understand.


### Useful resources
